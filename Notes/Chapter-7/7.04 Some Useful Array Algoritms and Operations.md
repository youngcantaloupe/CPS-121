#### Comparing Arrays
#arrays/comparingArrays
You cannot use the == operator to compare two array reference variables and determine whether the arrays are equal.

When you use the == operator with reference variables, including those that reference arrays, the operator compres the memory addresses that the variables contain, not the contents of the objects referenced by the variables. 

To compare the contents of two arrays, you must compare the elements of the two arrays:
``` java
	int[] firstArray = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 };
	int[] secondArray = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 };
	boolean arraysEqual = true;    //flag variable
	int index = 0;                 //loop control variable
	
	if (firstArray.length != secondArray.length)
		arraysEqual = false;
	
	while (arraysEqual && index < firstArray.length) {
		if (firstArray[index] != secondArray[index])
			arraysEqual = false;
		index++;
	}
	
	if (arraysEqual)
		System.out.println("The arrays are equal.");
	else
		System.out.println("The arrays are not equal.");
```

This code determines wheter *firstArray* and*secondArray* contain the same values. A *boolean* flag variable, *arraysEqual*, which is initialized to be *true*, is used to signal whether the arrays are equal. Another variable, *index* which  is initalized to 0, is used as a loop control variable.

- Determine wheter the two arrays are the same length.
	- if they are not the same length they aren't equal
- The loop executes as long as *arraysEqual* is *true* and the control variable *index* is less than *firstArray.length* 
- Each iteration compares the corresponding elements in the arrays
	- when it finds two corresponding elements that have different values, *arraysEqual* is set to false.
- After the loop finshes, an *if* statement examines the *arraysEqual* variable. 
	- if the variable is *true* it displays they're equal
	- if the variable is *false* it displays they're not equal

#### Summing the Values in a Numeric Array
#arrays/summingArrays
To sum values in an array you must use a loop with an accumulator variable. The loop adds the value in each array element to the accumulator. Given:
```java
	int[] units = new int[25];
```

The following loop adds the values of each element of the *units* array to the *total* variable.

``` java
	int total = 0;
	for (int index = 0; index < units.length; index++)
		total += units[index];
```
#### Averaging Values in a Numeric Array
#arrays/averagingArrays
To avererage you must first sum the array. Second is to divide the usm by the number of elements in an array.

``` java
	double[] scores = new double[10];
```

Below calculates the average in the *scores* array. Average will be stored in *average* variable.

``` java
	double total = 0;
	double average;
	for (int index = 0; index < scores.length; index++)
		total += scores[index];
	average = total / scores.length;
```

**NOTE** : Average is not calculated inside the loop.

#### Finding the Highest and Lowest Values in a Numeric Array
#arrays/minMaxArray
Finding the highest value in an array:
``` java
	int[] numbers = new int[50];

	int highest = numbers[0];
	for (int index = 1; index < numbers.length; index++) {
		if (numbers[index] > highest)
			highest = numbers[index];
	}
```

- Copy value in the first array element to the variable *highest*. 
- Loop compares all remaining array elements, beginning at subscript 1 to the value in *highest*.
- Each time it finds a value that is greater than *highest*, it copies that value to *highest* 

Finding the minimum value in an array:
``` java
	int lowest = numbers[0];
	for (int index = 1; index < numbers.length; index++) {
		if (numbers[index] < lowest)
			lowest = numbers[index];
	}
```
#### The *SalesData* Class
An instance of the class keeps sales amounts for any number of days in an array, which is a private field. Public methods are provided that return the total, average, highest, and lowest amounts of sales.

#arrays/SalesData
``` java
	public class SalesData {
		private double[] sales;
		
		public SalesData(double[] s) {
			sales = new double[s.length];
			
			for (int index = 0; index < s.length; index++)
				sales[index] = s[index];
		}
		public double getTotal() {
			double total = 0.0;
			
			for (int index = 0; index < sales.length; index++)
				total += sales[index];
				
				return total;
		}
		public double getAverage() {
			return getTotal() / sales.length;
		}
		public double getHighest() {
			double highest = sales[0];
			
			for (int index = 1; index < sales.length; index++) {
				if (sales[index] > highest)
					highest = sales[index];
			}
			return highest;
		}
		public double getLowest() {
			double lowets = sales[0];
			
			for (int index = 1; index < sales.length; index++) {
				if (sales[index] < lowest)
					lowest = sales[index];
			}
			return lowest;
		}
	}
```
#arrays/Sales
``` java
	import javax.swing.JOptionPane;
	
	public class Sales {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
		
			final int ONE_WEEK = 7;
			
			double[] sales = new double[ONE_WEEK];
			
			getValues(sales);
			
			SalesData week = new SalesData(sales);
			
			JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, String.format( 
				"Total: $%,.2f\n" +
				"Average: $%,.2f\n" +
				"Lowest: $%,.2f\n" +
				"Highest: $%,.2f\n",
				week.getTotal(),
				week.getAverage(),
				week.getLowest(),
				week.getHighest()));
				
		System.exit(0);
		}
		private static void getValues(double[] array) {
			String input; 
			
			for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
				input = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Sales for day " + (i + 1) + ".");
				array[i] = Double.parseDouble(input);
			}
		}
	}
```
#### Creating an Object That Processes an Array
#arrays/Grader
``` java
	public class Grader {
		private double[] testScores;
		
		public Grader(double[] scoreArray) {
			testScores = scoreArray;
		}
		public double getLowestScore() {
			double lowest;
			
			lowest = testScores[0];
			
			for (int index = 1; index < testScores.length; index++) {
				if (testScores[index] < lowest)
					lowest = testScores[index];
			}
			return lowest;
		}
		public double getAverage() {
			double total = 0;
			double lowest;
			double average;
			
			if (testScores.length < 2) {
				System.out.println("ERROR: You must have atleast two test scores.");
				average = 0;
			}
			else {
				for (double score : testScores)
					total += score;
				
				lowest = getLowestScore();
				
				total -= lowest;
				
				average = total / (testScores.length - 1);
			}
			return average;
		}
	}
```

- Declare field named *testScores*, which will be used to reference a *double* array of test scores.
- Constructor accepts a *double* array as an argument, which is assigned to the *testScores* field.
- *getLowestScore* method finds lowest value in the *testScores* array and returns the value.
- *getAverage* method first determines if there are atleast 2 elements in the *testScores* array.
	- if there is < 2 program is unable to drop the lowest score, and error displays.
	- the average is also set to 0. 
	- calculates the average of the test scores with the lowest score dropped, assigns that value to the *average* variable. 
	- returns the value of *average*

#arrays/CalcAverage
``` java
	import java.util.Scanner;
	public class CalcAverage {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
		
			int numScores;
			
			Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
			
			System.out.print("How many test scores do you have? ");
				numScores = keyboard.nextInt();
				
			double[] scores = new double[numScores];
			
			for (int index = 0; index < numScores; index++) {
				System.out.print("Enter score #" + (index + 1) + ": ");
				scores[index] = keyboard.nextDouble();
			} 
			Grader myGrader = new Grader(scores);
			
			System.out.println("Your adjusted average is " + myGrader.getAverage());
			
			System.out.println("Your lowest score is " + myGrader.getLowestScore());
		}
	}
```
#### Partially Filled Arrays
#arrays/partiallyFilledArrays
If you need to store a series of items in an array, but you don't know the number of items there are, you can make the array large enough to hold the largest possible number of items. 

If the actual number of items stored in an array is less than the number of elements, the array will be partially filled. When you process a partially filled array, you must only process the elements that contain valid data items.

A partially filled array is normally used withana ccompanying integer variable that holds the number of items stored in the array. 

``` java
	final int ARRAY_SIZE = 100;
	int[] array = new int[ARRAY_SIZE];
	int count = 0;
```

Each time an item is added to the array, *count* must be incremented.

``` java
	Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
	System.out.print("Enter a number or -1 to quit: ");
	number = keyboard.nextInt();
	while (number != -1 && count < array.length) {
		array[count] = number;
		count++;
		System.out.print("Enter a number or -1 to quit: ");
		number = keyboard.nextInt();
	}
```

Each iteration of this sentinel-controlled loop allows the user to enter a number to be stored in the array, or -1 to quit. The *count* variable is used as the subscript of the next available element in the array, and then incremented. When the user enters -1, or *count* reaches the size of the array, the loop stops. 

This code displays all the valid items in the array:
``` java
	for (int index = 0; index < count; index++){
		System.out.println(array[index]);
	}
```

**NOTE** : Code uses *count* to determine the maximum array subscript to use.

**NOTE** : If a partially filled array is passed as an argument to a method, the variable that holds the count of items in the array must also be passed as an argument. Otherwise, the method will note be able to determine the number of items that are stored in the array.

#### Working with Arrays and Files
#arrays/arrayFiles
- Saving the contents of an array to a file: 
	- use a loop to step through each element of the array, writing its contents to the file

Declared array: 
``` java
	int[] numbers = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };
```

Open a file named *Values.txt* and write each of the elements of *numbers* to the file

``` java
	int[] numbers = { 10, 20 , 30, 40, 50 };
	PrintWriter outputFile = new PrintWriter("Values.txt");
	
	for (int index = 0; index < numbers.length; index++)
		outputFile.println(numbers[index]);
	outputFile.close();
``` 

How to open *Values.txt* file and read its contents back into the *numbers* array

``` java
	final int SIZE = 5;
	int[] numbers = new int[SIZE];
	
	File file = new File("Values.txt");
	Scanner inputFile = new Scanner(file);
	
	while (inputFile.hasNext() && index < numbers.length) {
		numbers[index] = inputFile.nextInt();
		index++;
	}
	inputFile.close();
```

- Open the file
- *while* loop reads all the values from the file into the *numbers* array
- Loop repeats while *inputFile.hasNext()* returns *true* and *index* is less than *numbers.length* 
- *inputFile.hasNext()* method is called to there is a value remaining in the file
	- this prevents an error in case the file does not contain enough values to fill the array
- Second condition *(index < numbers.length)* prevents the loop from writing outside the array boundaries
