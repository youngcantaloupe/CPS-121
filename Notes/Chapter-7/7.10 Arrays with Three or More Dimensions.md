#### CONCEPT: Java does not limit the number of dimensions that an array can have. It is possible to create arrays with mulitple dimensions, to model data that occurs in multiple sets.

Example of a three dimensional array:

``` java
double[][][] seats = new double[3][5][8];
```

This array can be thought of as three sets of five rows, each row containing eight elements. 

**Use Case** : Could store prices of seats in an auditorium, where there are eight seats in a row, five rows in a section, and a total of three sections. 

**Use Case** : A factory warehouse where cases of widgets are stacked on pallets, an array with four dimensions could be used to store a part number of each widget. The for subscripts of each element could represent the pallet number, case number, row number, and column number of each widget. 
- Similarly, an array with five dimensions could be used if there were multiple warehouses.
