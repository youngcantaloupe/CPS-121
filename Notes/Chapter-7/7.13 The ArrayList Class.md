**CONCEPT: *ArrayList* is a class in the Java API that is similar to an array and allows you to store objects. Unlike an array, an *ArrayList* object's size is automatically adjusted to accommodate the number of items being stored in it.**

*ArrayList* can be used to store and retreiving objects. This is similar to an array of objects, but has advantages over an array:
- An *ArrayList* object automatically expands as items are added to it.
- An *ArrayList* can add and remove objects.
- An *ArrayList* also shrinks as items are removed.

The *ArrayList* class is in the *java.util* package. Use this to import:

``` java
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

#### Creating and Using an *ArrayList* Object**

Creating an *ArrayList* object:

``` java
ArrayList<String> nameList = new ArrayList<String>();
```

This creates the *ArrayList* object and stores its address in the *nameList* variable.
- < String > specifies that this ArrayList can hold String objects.
- An error will occur if any other type of object.

To add items:

``` java
nameList.add("James");
nameList.add("Catherine");
nameList.add("Bill");
```

The items in an *ArrayList* have a corresponding index. The index specifies the item's location in the *ArrayList*, this is like an array subscript.
- Starting at 0 and continues on.

The *ArrayList* class has a *size* method that reports the number of items stored in an *ArrayList*. It returns the number of items as an *int*. 

To display number of items stored in *nameList*:

```java
System.out.println("The ArrayList has " + nameList.size() + " objects sroed in it.");
```

The *ArrayList* class's *get* method returns an item stored at a specific index.

```java
System.out.println(nameList.get(1));
```

Put together:

``` java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ArrayListDemo1 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ArrayList<String> nameList = new ArrayList<String>();
		
		nameList.add("James");
		nameList.add("Catherine");
		nameList.add("Bill");
		
		System.out.println("The ArrayList has " + nameList.size() + " objects stored in it.");
		for(int index = 0; index < nameList.size(); index++) 
			System.out.println(nameList.get(index));
	}
}
```

**NOTICE** : The *for* loop uses the value returned from *nameList*'s *size* method to control the number of times the loop iterates. 
- This is to prevent bounds checking error from occuring.
- The last item stored in *ArrayList* will have an index that is 1 less than the *size* of the *ArrayList*. If you pass a value larger than this to the *get* method, an error will occur.

#### Using the Enhanced *for* Loop with an *ArrayList* 

The *enhanced for loop* can be used to iterate over each *element* in an array. This can also be done to iterate over each item in an *ArrayList* as well.

``` java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ArrayListDemo2 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ArrayList<String> nameList = new ArrayList<String>();
		
		nameList.add("James");
		nameList.add("Catherine");
		nameList.add("Bill");
		
		System.out.println("The ArrayList has " + nameList.size() + " objects stored in it.");
		for (String name : nameList)
			System.out.println(name);
	}
}
```

#### The *ArrayList* Class's *toString* Method

The *ArrayList* class has a *toString* method taht returns a string representing all of the items stored in an *ArrayList* object. 
- For example, imagine the same *nameList* object setup previously.

We can use this statement to display all the names:

``` java
System.out.println(nameList);
```

The contents of the *ArrayList* will be displayed like:

``` java
[James, Catherine, Bill]
```

Example in [[ArrayListToString.java]]

#### Removing an Item from an *ArrayList*

The *ArrayList* class has a *remove* method that removes an item at a specific index. You pass the index as an argument to the method.

``` java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ArrayListDemo3 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ArrayList<String> nameList = new ArrayList<String>();
		
		nameList.add("James");
		nameList.add("Catherine");
		nameList.add("Bill");
		
		for (int index = 0; index < nameList.size(); index++) {
			System.out.println("Index: " + index + " Name: " + nameList.get(index));
		}
		nameList.remove(1);
		
		System.out.println("The item at index 1 is removed. Here are the items now.");
		for (int index = 0; index < nameList.size(); index++) {
		System.out.println("Index: " + index + " Name: " + nameList.get(index));
		}
	}
}
```

**NOTE** : When the item at index 1 was removed, the item that was previously stored at index 2 was shifted into index position 1.

- An error will occur if you call the *remove* method with an invalid index.

#### Inserting an Item

The *add* method adds an item to the last position in the *ArrayList* object. 
- The *ArrayList* class has an overloaded version of the *add* method that allows you to add an item at a specific index. (shown below)

``` java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ArrayListDemo4 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ArrayList<String> nameList = new ArrayList<String>();
		
		nameList.add("James");
		nameList.add("Catherine");
		nameList.add("Bill");
		
		for (int index = 0; index < nameList.size(); index++) {
			System.out.println("Index: " + index + "Name: " + nameList.get(index));
		}
		nameList.add(1, "Mary");
		
		System.out.println("Mary was added at index 1. Here are the items now.");
		
		for (int index = 0; index < nameList.size(); index++) {
		System.out.println("Index: " + index + "Name: " + nameList.get(index));
		}
	}
}
```

**NOTE** : When an item was removed, the list shifted downward, and when an item was added, the list shifted upward.

#### Replacing an Item

The *ArrayList* class's *set* method can be used to replace an item at a specific index with another item.

Shown in [[ArrayListDemo5.java]]

#### Capacity

An *ArrayList* object also has a *capacity*, which is the number of items it can store without having to incrrease its size. 
- When an *ArrayList* object is first created with a no-arg constructor, it has an inital capacity of 10 items.
- You can specify a different starting capacity, by passing an int into the *ArrayList* constructor as an argument.

``` java
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>(100);
```

#### Storing Your Own Objects in an *ArrayList*

You can create an *ArrayList* to hold any type of object. 
- Below shows an *ArrayList* that can hold *BankAccount* objects.

``` java
ArrayList<BankAccount> accountList = new ArrayList<BankAccount>();
```

``` java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ArrayListDemo6 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ArrayList<BankAccount> list = new ArrayList<BankAccount>();
		
		list.add(new BankAccount(100.0));
		list.add(new BankAccount(500.0));
		list.add(new BankAccount(1500.0));
		
		for (int index = 0; index < list.size(); index++) {
			BankAccount account = list.get(index);
			System.out.println("Account at index " + index + "\nBalance: " 
			 + account.getBalance());
		}	
	}
}
```

#### Using the Diamond Operator for Type Inference

You can simplifiy the instantiation of an *ArrayList* by using the *diamond operator* ( <> ). 
- Many programs listed above create and *ArrayList* using statements like this:

```java
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
```

The data type appears twice in this statement, first when declaring the reference variable, and second when calling the *ArrayList* constructor.
- Now with Java 7, you are no longer required to write the data type in the part of the statement htat calls the *ArrayList* constructor. Instead you can leave the angled brackets empty:

``` java
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
```

This set of empty angled brackets is called the *diamond operator*. It causes the compiler to infer the required data type from the reference variable declaration.
