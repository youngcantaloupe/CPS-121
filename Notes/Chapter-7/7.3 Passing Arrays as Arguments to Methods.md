#### CONCEPT: An array can be passed as an argument to a method. To pass an array, you pass the value in the variable that references the array. 

It is useful to write methods that process data in arrays. Methods can be written to sroe values in an array, display an array's contents, total all of an array's elements, calculate their average, and so forth. Usually, such methods accept an array as an argument.

When a single element of an array is passed to a method, it is handled like any other variable. 

#arrays/PassElements
``` java
	public class PassElements {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
		
			int[] numbers = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40};
			
			for (int index = 0; index < numbers.length; index++)
				showValue(numbers[index]);
		}
		public static void showValue(int n) {
			System.out.print(n + " ");
		}
	}
```

Each time *showValue* is called in this program, an array elemnt is passed to the method. The *showValue* method has an *int* parameter variable named *n*. 

If the method were written to accept the entire array as an argument, the parameter would have to be set up differently. 

The parameter *array* is declared as an array reference variable. This indicates that the argument will be an array, not a single value.

``` java
	public static void showArray(int[] array) {
		for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
			System.out.print(array[i] + " ");
	}
``` 

When you pass an array as an argument, you pass the value in the variable that references the array:
``` java
	showArray(numbers);
```

When an entire array is passed into a method, it is passed just as an object is passed: The actual array itself is not passed, but a reference to the array is passed into the parameter. Consequently, this means the method has direct access to the orignal array. 

#arrays/PassArray
``` java
	import java.util.Scanner;
	
	public class PassArray {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
		
			final int ARRAY_SIZE = 4;
			
			int[] numbers = new int[ARRAY_SIZE];
			
			getValues(numbers);
			
			System.out.println("Here are the numbers that you entered:");
			
			showArray(numbers);
		}
		private static void getValues(ing[] array) {
			Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
			
			System.out.println("Enter a series of " + array.length + " numbers.");
			
			for (int index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
				System.out.print("Enter number " + (index + 1) + ": ");
				array[index] = keyboard.nextInt();
			}
		}
		public static void showArray(int[] array) {
			for (int index = 0; index < array.length; index++) 
				System.out.print(array[index] + " ");
		}
	}
```
