#### CONCEPT: You may create arrays of objects that are instances of classes that you have written. 

Like any other data type, you can create arrays of class objects. Recall the  [[BankAccount]] class from [[Chapter6]]. An array of *BankAccount* objects could be created to represent all of the bank accounts owned by a single person.

``` java
final int NUM_ACCOUNTS = 5;
BankAccount[] accounts = new BankAccount[NUM_ACCOUNTS];
```

The variable that references the array is called *accounts*. As with *String* arrays, each element in this array is a reference variable.

Remember, that each element of the array is initialized with the value *null*. This just means that the array elements do not yet reference any objects.

You must individually create the objects that each element will reference. Below is a loop to do so:

``` java
for (int index = 0; index < accounts. length; index++) 
	accounts[index] = new BankAccount();
```

This calls the *no-arg constructor* for each object. The [[BankAccount]] class has a no-arg constructor that assigns 0.0 to the *balance* field. After the loop executes, each element of the *accounts* array will reference a *BankAccount* object.

Objects in an array are accessed with subscripts, just like any other data types in an array. For example, the following code uses the *accounts[2]* element to call the *setBalance* and *withdraw* methods from the [[BankAccount]] class.

``` java
accounts[2].setBalance(2500.0);
accounts[2].withdraw(500.0);
```

This is a complete program that uses an array of objects.

``` java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ObjectArray {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		final int NUM_ACCOUNTS = 3;
		
		BankAccount[] accounts = new BankAccount[NUM_ACCOUNTS];
		
		createAccounts(accounts);
		
		System.out.println("Here are the balances for each account: ");
		
		for (int index = 0; index < accounts.length; index++) {
			System.out.println("Account " + (index + 1) + accounts[index].getBalance());
		}
	}
	private static void createAccounts(BankAccount[] array) {
		double balance;
		
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		for (int index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
			System.out.print("Enter the balance for account " + (index + 1) + ": ");
			balance = keyboard.nextDouble();
			
			array[index] = new BankAccount(balance);
		}
	}
}
```
