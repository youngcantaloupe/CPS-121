#### CONCEPT: A search algorithm is a method of locating a specific item in a larger collection of data. This section discusses the sequential search algorithm, which is a simple technique for searching the contents of an array.

It is very common for programs to store and process information in arrays, and also to search arrays for specific items. 

 - The sequential search algorithm uses a loop to sequentially step through an array, starting with the first element. 
 - It compares each element with the vlaue being searched for and stops then the value is found or the end of the array is encountered.
 - If the value being searched for is not in the array, the algoritm unsuccessfully searches to the end of the array.

The *SearchArray* program searches the five-element array *tests* to find a score of 100. It uses a method, *sequentialSearch*, to find the value in the array. 

The array that is passed as an argument into the *array* parameter is searches for an occurrence of the number passed into *value*. if the number is found, its array subscript is returned. Otherwise, -1 is returned.

``` java
public class SearchArray {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		int[] tests = { 87, 75, 98, 100, 82 };
		int results;
		
		results = sequentialSearch(tests, 100);
		
		if (results == -1) {
			System.out.println("You did not earn 100 on any tests.");
		}
		else {
			System.out.println("You earned 100 on test " + (results + 1));
		}
	}
	public static int sequentialSearch(int[] array, int value) {
		
		int index;
		int element;
		boolean found;
		
		index = 0;
		
		element = -1;
		found = false;
		
		while (!found && index < array.length) {
			if (array[index] == value) {
				found = true;
				element = index;
			}
			index++;
		}	
		return element;
	}
}
```
