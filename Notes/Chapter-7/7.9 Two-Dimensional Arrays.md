#### CONCEPT: A two-dimensional array is an array of arrays. It can be thought of as having rows and columns

Arrays are useful for sorting and working with a set of data.

You can also be useful to work with multiple sets of data
- For example, in a grade-averaging program a teacher might record all of one student's test scores in an array of *doubles*. 
- If the teacher has 30 students, they will need 30 arrays to record the scores for the entire class.
In this case it would be better to define a two-dimensional array.

One-dimensional arrays hold one set of data.

Two-dimensional arrays can hold multiple sets of data.
- Although 2D arrays are actually an array of arrays, it's easier to think about it as having rows and columns of elements.

To declare a two-dimensional array, two sets of brackets and two size declarators are required.
- The first one is for the number of rows.
- The second one is for the number of columns.

``` java
double[][] scores = new double [3][4];
```

- This would be a three row, four column array. 

#### Processing

Each element has two subscripts
- One for the row
- One for the column

##### *Scores* array
Elements in row 0:
``` java
scores[0][0]
scores[0][1]
scores[0][2]
scores[0][3]
```
Elements in row 1:
``` java
scores[1][0]
scores[1][1]
scores[1][2]
scores[1][3]
```
Elements in row 2:
``` java
scores[2][0]
scores[2][1]
scores[2][2]
scores[2][3]
```

To access one of the elements in a two-dimensional array, you must use both subscripts.
``` java
scores[2][1] = 95;
```
This stores 95 is row two column one.

Programs that process two-dimensional arrays can do so with nested loops.
``` java
final int ROWS = 3;
final int COLS = 4;
double[][] scores = new double[ROWS][COLS];
for (int row = 0; row < ROWS; row++) {
	for (int col = 0; col < COLS; col++) {
		System.out.print("Enter a score: ");
		scores[row][col] = keyboard.nextDouble();
	}
}
```
This prompts the user to enter a score, once for each element in the array.

This displays all the elements in the *scores* array.
``` java
for (int row = 0; row < ROWS; row++) {
	for (int col = 0; col < COLS; col++) {
		System.out.println(scores[row][col]);
	}

}
```

Code below uses two-dimensional array to store corporate sales data.
- Three rows, one for each division of the company.
- Four columns, one for each quarter.

``` java
import java.util.Scanner;

pulblic class CorpSales {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		final int DIVS = 3;
		final int QTRS = 4;
		double totalSales = 0.0;
		
		double[][] sales = new double[DIVS][QTRS];
		
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		System.out.println("This program will calculate the total sales of");
		System.out.println("all of the company's divisions. Enter the following sales data:");
		
		for (int div = 0; div < DIVS; div++) {
			for (int qtr = 0; qtr < QTRS; qtr++) {
				System.out.printf("Division %d, Quarter %d: $", (div + 1), (qtr +1));
				sales[div][qtr] = keyboard.nextDouble();
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
		for (int div = 0; div < DIVS; div++) {
			for (int qtr = 0; qtr < QTRS; qtr++) {
				totalSales += sales[div][qtr];
			}
		}
		System.out.printf("total company sales $%,.2f\n", totalSales);
	}
}
```

#### Initalizing a Two-Dimensional Array

When initializing a two-dimensional array, you enclose each row's initialization list in its own set of braces:

``` java
int[][] numbers = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} };
```

As with one-dimensional arrays, you do not use the *new* keyword when you provide an initialization list. Java automatically creates the array and fills its elements with the initialization values.
- Row 0 = 1, 2, 3
- Row 1 = 4, 5, 6
- Row 2 = 7, 8, 9

**NOTE** : You can also write these initialization lists across multiple lines for clarity.
``` java
int[][] numbers = { {1, 2, 3},
					{4, 5, 6},
					{7, 8, 9} };
```

#### The *length* Field in a Two-Dimensional Array

A one-dimensional array has a *length* field that holds the number of elements in the array.

A two-dimensional array has multiple *length* fields.
- One that holds the rows.
- One that holds the columns.

Below shows how to use *length* fields to display the number of rows and columns in a two-dimensional array.

``` java
public class Lengths {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[][] numbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4},
							{5, 6, 7, 8},
							{9, 10, 11, 12} };
		System.out.println("The number of rows is " + numbers.length);
		
		for (int index = 0; index < numbers.length; index++); {
			System.out.println("The number of columns in row " + index + " is " + numbers[index].length);
		}
	}
}
```


#### Displaying All the Elements of a Two-Dimensional Array

In previous examples, a pair of nested loops can be used to display all the elements of a two-dimensional array.  For example,

``` java
int[][] numbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4},
					{5, 6, 7, 8},
					{9, 10, 11, 12} };
for (int row = 0; row < 3; row++) {
	for (int col = 0; col < 4; col++) {
		System.out.println(numbers[row][col]);
	}
}
```

This will display all of the elements, but it is limited.
- Loops are specifically written to display an array with three rows and four columns. 
- A better way to approach is to use the array's *length* fields for the upper limit of the subscripts in the loop test expression

``` java
for (int row = 0; row < numbers.length; row++) {
	for (int col = 0; col < numbers[row].length; col++) {
		System.out.println(numbers[row][col]);
	}
}
```

The outer loop header controls the subscript for the *number* array's rows. 
- Because *numbers.length* holds the number of rows in the array, we have used it as the upper limit for the row of subscripts.

The inner loop header controls the subscript for the *number* array's columns.
- Because each row's *length* field holds the number of columns in the row, we have used it as the upper limit for the column subscripts.
 
 By using the *length* fields in algorithmsthat process two-dimensional arrays you can write code that works with arrays of any number of rows and columns.

#### Summing All the Elements of a Two-Dimensional Array

To sum all the elements of a two-dimensional array, you use a pair of nested loops to add the contents of each element to an accumulator.

``` java
int[][] numbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4},
					{5, 6, 7, 8},
					{9, 10, 11, 12} };
int total = 0;

for (int row = 0; row < numbers.length; row++) {
	for (int col = 0; col < numbers[row].length; col++) {
		total += numbers[row][col];
	}
}
System.out.println("The total is " + total);
```

#### Summing the Rows of a Two-Dimensonal Array

**Use case** : If a two-dimensional array is used to hold a set of test scores for a set of students. Each row in the array is a set of test scores for one student. To get the sum of a student's test scores, you use a loop to add all the elements in one row. 

``` java
int [][] numbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4},
					{5, 6, 7, 8},
					{9, 10, 11, 12} };
int total;
for (int row = 0; row < numbers.length; row++) {
	total = 0;
	
	for (int col = 0; col < numbers[row].length; col++) {
		total += numbers[row][col];
	}
	System.out.println("Total of row " + row + " is " + total);
}
```

**Notice** : The *total* variable, which is used as an accumulator, is set to zero just before the inner loop executes, becuase the inner loop sums the elements of a row and stores the sum in *total* 
- The *total* variable must be set to zero before each iteration of the inner loop.

#### Summing the Columns of a Two-Dimensional Array

**Use case** : With the same example of the array holding test scores for students, you may want to calculate the average test score for a set of students. 
- This is accomplished with a set of nested loops.
	- the outer loop controls the column subscript and the inner loop controls the row subscript.
	- the inner loop calculates the sum of a column, which is stored in an accumulator.

``` java
int [][] numbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4},
					{5, 6, 7, 8},
					{9, 10, 11, 12} };
int total;
for (int col = 0; col < numbers[0].length; col++) {
	total = 0;
	
	for (int row = 0; row < numbers.length; row++) {
		total += numbers[row][col];
	}
System.out.println("Total of column " + col + " is " + total);
}
```

#### Passing Two-Dimensional Arrays to Methods

When a two-dimensional array is passed to a method, the parameter must be declared as a reference to a two-dimensional array. The following method header shows an example:

``` java
private static void showArray(int[][] array)
```

This method's header, *array*, is declared as a reference to a two-dimensional *int* array. 
- Any two-dimensional *int* array can be passed as an argument to a method.

Here are two methods:

``` java
public class Pass2Darray {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[][] numbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4},
							{5, 6, 7, 8},
							{9, 10, 11, 12} };
		System.out.println("Here are the values in the array.");
		showArray(numbers);
		System.out.println("The sum of the values is " + arraySum(numbers));
	}
	private static void showArray(int[][] array) {
		for (int row = 0; row < array.length; row++) {
			for (int col = 0; col < array[row].length; col++) {
				System.out.print(array[row][col] + " " );
				System.out.println();
			}
		}
	}
	priavte static int arraySum(int[][] array) {
		int total = 0;
		
		for (int row = 0; row < array.length; row++) {
			for (int col = 0; col < array[row].length; col++) {
				total += array[row][col];
			}
		}
		return total;
	}
}
```

#### Ragged Arrays

Because the rows in a two-dimensional array are also arrays, each row can have its own length.
- When the rows of a two-dimensional array have different lengths it is known as a *ragged array*.

You create a ragged array by first creating a two-dimensional array with a specific number of rows, but no columns.

``` java
int[][] ragged = new int[4][];
```

This partially creates a two-dimensional array. 
- It can have four rows, but they haven't been created yet. 

Next, you create the individual rows:

``` java
ragged[0] = new int[3];   //row 0 has 3 columns
ragged[1] = new int[4];   //row 1 has 4 columns
ragged[2] = new int[5];   //row 2 has 5 columns
ragged[3] = new int[6];   //row 3 has 6 columns
```

How to display the number of columns in each row:

``` java
for (int index = 0; index, ragged.length; inded++) {
	System.out.println("The number of columns in row " + index + " is " + ragged[index].length);
}
```
