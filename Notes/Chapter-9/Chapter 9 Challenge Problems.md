## Backward String
Write a method that accepts a String object as an argument and displays its contents backward. For instance, if the string argument is “gravity” the method should display -“ytivarg”. Demonstrate the method in a program that asks the user to input a string and then passes it to the method.

## Word Counter
Write a method that accepts a String object as an argument and returns the number of words it contains. For instance, if the argument is “Four score and seven years ago” the method should return the number 6. Demonstrate the method in a program that asks the user to input a string and then passes it to the method. The number of words in the string should be displayed on the screen.

## Vowels and Consonants
Write a class with a constructor that accepts a String object as its argument. The class should have a method that returns the number of vowels in the string, and another method that returns the number of consonants in the string. Demonstrate the class in a program that performs the following steps:
	1. The user is asked to enter a string.
	2. The program displays the following menu:
		Count the number of vowels in the string
		Count the number of consonants in the string
		Count both the vowels and consonants in the string
		Enter another string
		Exit the program
	3. The program performs the operation selected by the user and repeats until the user selects e, to exit the program.

## Word Separator
Write a program that accepts as input a sentence in which all of the words are run together, but the first character of each word is uppercase. Convert the sentence to a string in which the words are separated by spaces and only the first word starts with an uppercase letter. For example, the string “StopAndSmellTheRoses.” would be converted to “Stop and smell the roses.”
